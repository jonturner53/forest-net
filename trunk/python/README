vworld1 - the original virtual world demo
	  that does not require the Panda3D engine; we can have
	  both C++ and python versions of the Avatar;
	  useful to retain this for pure networking
	  experiments, where we are not concerned with dealing
	  with a real virtual world; so the python version will 
	  use WorldMap for both visibility and auto operation

vworld2 - a basic panda demo for others who may want to build
	  their own games; we'll keep it simple

vworld2a - adding more features to vworld2

vworld3 - a version for scalable communications
