New version of vworld2 that will enventually integrate all new
features added over the summer. Getting there.

Code for names and downloading pictures
- add command-line argument, pass to Net
- add missing components to UserWorld (take from wuTour)

Other things that need work - ask Chao to look at these
- view self feature only works for panda avatar
- user names not being placed correctly; adjust so they hover just over
  avatar; may want to add keyboard shortcut to toggle names on/off also

Collision detection produces poor results for automated bots.
Also, consumes lots of processing time. Replace with graph-based
model. Define a set of "places". Each place has a pair of coordinates
and a list of neighbors. The line joining neighbors is guaranteed to
be collision-free.

Start each auto avatar at some random place, pointing to a neighbor
which is its current target. When an avatar gets close to the current
target, pick a new target at random from among the current target's
neighbors, and start turning in its direction.
