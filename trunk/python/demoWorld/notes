New version of vworld2 that will enventually integrate all new
features added by students over the summer. Not there yet.

Code for names and downloading pictures
- add command-line argument, pass to Net
- add missing components to UserWorld (take from wuTour)

Audio
- add command-line flag so can easily turn on/off
- test that it still works

Doowon's code to set size of world
- mostly done, do some testing

For now, stick with distributing avatars through svn.
Let users just do an svn up, whenever they want.
Accept new avatars from anyone interested and add to repo.

Standard names: ava-123.egg, walk-123.egg, tex-123.egg
Chao suggests changing these to facilitate export from Blender

Other things that need work - ask Chao to look at these
- model origin is (-5,-5); shift to (0,0)
- view self feature only works for panda avatar
- collision detection
- user names not being placed correctly; adjust so they hover just over
  avatar; may want to toggle names on/off also
