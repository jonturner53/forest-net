New version of vworld2 that will enventually integrate all new
features added over the summer. Getting there.

Code for names and downloading pictures
- add command-line argument, pass to Net
- add missing components to UserWorld (take from wuTour)

Audio
- add command-line flag so can easily turn on/off
- test that it still works

Standard names: ava-123.egg, walk-123.egg, tex-123.egg
Chao suggests changing these to facilitate export from Blender

Other things that need work - ask Chao to look at these
- model origin is (-5,-5); shift to (0,0)
- view self feature only works for panda avatar
- collision detection not working
- user names not being placed correctly; adjust so they hover just over
  avatar; may want to add keyboard shortcut to toggle names on/off also
