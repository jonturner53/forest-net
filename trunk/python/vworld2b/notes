Supporting multiple avatars

1. Add command line argument to give serial number of model files.
   Use names of form ava1234.egg and walk1234.egg.
   Pass serial number to PandaWorld and Net.

2. Net includes avatar serial number in reports and passes the
   serial number of received reports to PandaWorld.

3. Maintain a list of lists called actorCache. Entry i is a list of unused 
   Actor objects with serial number i. When a new avatar shows up in the
   scene we look in actorCache for an unused Actor. If we don't find one,
   we create one. When an avatar goes out of view, we places its Actor
   back in actorCache.
