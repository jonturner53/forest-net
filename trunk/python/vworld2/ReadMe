1. While Panda3D runs Python 2.5, Avatar.py must be run on Python 2.7.
   To make Panda3D runs Python 2.7, do the following:

   sudo cp /Library/Python/2.5/site-packages/Panda3D.pth /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/
   export VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT=yes


2. walls24 is the 2D mapping of the 3D map "vworld-grid-24". All files are
   located in models/; 2Dmap.png is the top view of the 3D map.
   The 3D model was created using SketchUp. SketchUp can export a model in
   the .dae format. The script 2egg.sh converts .dae into the .egg format.
   To make the collision mesh work (see the comment in def __init___() in
   vworld2.py), copy the content of collision.cfg into appropriate places
   in the .egg file.
