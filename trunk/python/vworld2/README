1. While Panda3D runs Python 2.5, Avatar.py must be run on Python 2.7.
   To make Panda3D runs Python 2.7, copy Panda3D.pth from Python 2.5
   site-packages directory into Python 2.7's site-packages directory.
   Type "ppython -m" and "python -m" to locate those directories.

   For OS X, we need to tell it run the 32-bit version:
		export VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT=yes
   for Linux/Windows, install 32-bit python package.

   After that, run it with command "python" instead of "ppython".

2. Add the following line to Config.prc:

		window-type none

   For OS X, Config.prc is located at /Developer/Panda3D/etc/

3. All model files are located in models/; 2Dmap.png is the top view
   of the 3D map. The 3D model was created using SketchUp. SketchUp
   can export a model in the .dae format. The script 2egg.sh converts
   .dae into the .egg format. To make the collision mesh work
   (see the comment in def __init___() in vworld2.py), copy the content
   of collision.cfg into appropriate places in the .egg file.

   Note: It seems that the exporting/converting process is unstable.
   For two sided objects, Panda3D might use different side as a front side
   at each run (even though we choose 'export only one side' when exporting
   the .skp file). The current solution is to color both sides of an object
   with the same texture. Also, note that the ambient values in a .egg file
   might be zero (i.e., ambr,ambg,ambb in <Material>); if this is the case,
   ambient lighting won't work on these objects. We need to manually
   replace them by nonzero values, or we use shaders.
