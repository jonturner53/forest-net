This directory contains sources for an overlay router and host
that implement the Lightweight Flow Setup extension to IPv4.
This extension is described in a paper in the 2003 Allerton
Conference (www.arl.wustl.edu/~jst/pubs/allterton03lfs.pdf).

It allows a host to request reserved capacity by sending a
packet with an IP option and the requested amount of bandwidth.
The routers along the path attempt to satisfy the request,
possibly choosing a path different from the default
forwarding path.

The code is adapted from the Forest router.
