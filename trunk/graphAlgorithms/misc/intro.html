<h1>Miscellaneous Algorithms</i></h1>
<p>
This page provides links to source code that implements miscellaneous
algorithms.
There is an associated makefile
which can be used to compile all the programs.
The makefile assumes a particular directory structure.
Specifically, the various groups of algorithms are stored in
sub-directories with a common parent. The parent of this directory
is assumed to have a child directory called data_structures,
where various data_structures can be found.
<p>
The links at left provide access to all the same files that
can be accessed through the links below. Once one becomes familiar
with the various files, these shortcut links provide a more
convenient way to access the code.
<ul>
<li>	<i>Breadth First Search</i>. Reads in an undirected graph
	from stdin and prints out a list of its vertices in breadth-first
	order, starting from vertex 1. Usage: bfs.
	<a href="bfs.c" target="main">Source</a>.
<li>	<i>Topological Sort</i>. Reads in a directed acyclic graph
	from stdin and creates an equivalent graph in which the vertices
	are topologically sorted (all go from lower numbered vertices
	to higher numbered vertices. Usage: topsort.
	<a href="toposort.c" target="main">Source</a>.
<li>	<i>Copy Graph</i>. Copies a graph of specified type from stdin
	to stdout. Mainly intended to verify graph IO operations.
	Usage: cgraph type.
	<a href="cgraph.c" target="main">Source</a>.
<li>	<i>Random Graph</i>. Generates a random graph of a specified
	type, with a specified number of vertices and edges.
	Allows the range of edges to be limited to a specified "span"
	and allows vertices to be optionally "scrambled".
	Usage: rgraph type nVertex nEdge span scram [optional args] seed.
	<a href="rgraph.c" target="main">Source</a>.
