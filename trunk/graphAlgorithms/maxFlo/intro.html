<h1>Max Flow Algorithms</i></h1>
<p>
This page provides links to source code for various algorithms
for the maximum flow problem.
There is an associated makefile
which can be used to compile all the programs.
The makefile assumes a particular directory structure.
Specifically, the various groups of algorithms are stored in
sub-directories with a common parent. The parent of this directory
is assumed to have a child directory called data_structures,
where various data_structures can be found.
<p>
The links at left provide access to all the same files that
can be accessed through the links below. Once one becomes familiar
with the various files, these shortcut links provide a more
convenient way to access the code.
<ul>
<li>	<i>Augmenting Path Algorithm</i>. Implements three
	variants: max capacity augmentation, capacity scaling
	and shortest path.
	<a href="augPath.c" target="main">Source</a>.
<li>	<i>Dinic's Algorithm</i>. 
	<a href="dinic.c" target="main">Source</a>.
<li>	<i>Dinic's Algorithm with Dynamic Trees</i>.
	<a href="dinicDtrees.c" target="main">Source</a>.
<li>	<i>Preflow-push Algorithm</i>. Implements two variants:
	FIFO with incremental relabeling
	and FIFO with batch relabeling.
	<a href="prePush.c" target="main">Source</a>.
<li>    <i>Max Flow Command</i>. Reads an input
        graph and computes a max flow using a specified spt algorithm.
        <a href="maxFlo.c" target="main">Source</a>.
<li>    <i>Max Flow Repeat Command</i>. Generates random
        graphs and computes a max flow using a specified algorithm.
        <a href="maxFloRep.c" target="main">Source</a>.
<li>	<i>Max Flow Checker</i>. Reads a flow graph from stdin
	and checks to see if the defined flow is a legal maximum flow.
	It prints messages whenever it finds something incorrect.
	If the flow is correct, there is no output.
	Usage: check.
	<a href="check.c" target="main">Source</a>.
