<h1>Matching Algorithms</i></h1>
<p>
This page provides links to source code that implements algorithms
for the matching problem.
There is an associated makefile
which can be used to compile all the programs.
The makefile assumes a particular directory structure.
Specifically, the various groups of algorithms are stored in
sub-directories with a common parent. The parent of this directory
is assumed to have a child directory called data_structures,
where various data_structures can be found.
<p>
The links at left provide access to all the same files that
can be accessed through the links below. Once one becomes familiar
with the various files, these shortcut links provide a more
convenient way to access the code.
<ul>
<li>	<i>Alternating Path Algorithm for Unweighted Matching in
	Bipartite Graphs</i>.
	<a href="altPath.c" target="main">Source</a>.
<li>	<i>Faster Version of Alternating Path Algorithm for Unweighted
	Matching in Bipartite Graphs</i>.
	This version is organized to avoid the per search
	initialization overhead that can slow down the basic version.
	<a href="faltPath.c" target="main">Source</a>.
<li>	<i>Bipartite Matching Algorithms using Flows</i>.
	Implements two variants, one for max size matchings,
	one for max weight matcings.
	<a href="flowMatch.c" target="main">Source</a>.
<li>    <i>Matching Command</i>. Reads an input
        graph and computes a maximum matching using a specified algorithm
        <a href="match.c" target="main">Source</a>.
<li>    <i>Matching Repeat Command</i>. Generates random
        graphs and computes a maximum matcing using a specified algorithm.
        <a href="matchRep.c" target="main">Source</a>.
