Things to do - 2/15/10

1. In mst, still need to re-write check, mstUpdate.

3. Generalize spt routines to take a specified source vertex.

10.Finish implementing the scaling algorithm for min cost
   max flow.

11.Implement Edmonds algorithm for max size matching in
   general graphs.

12.Consider adding a verify routine to each data structure.
   It would implement a series of consistency checks on the
   data structure and could be invoked by any client
   program using the data structure. Or, we could set a
   debug flag in the data structure's private area that
   would trigger a consistency check on each method
   invocation. Maybe multiple levels.

13.Think about having mst programs return list instead
   of wgraph.
