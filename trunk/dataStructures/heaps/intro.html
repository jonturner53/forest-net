<h1>Heaps</h1>
<p>
This page provides links to source code for various types of heaps.
The data structures are implemented as C++ classes,
so there is a header file (.h) and source file (.c) for each
data structure. Most data structures also have an associated
driver, which is a command that can be used to exercise the
various data structure operations and verify that the code works
as expected.
<p>
A makefile is provided. It assumes a certain directory
structure. In particular, the different data structure
directories all have a common parent and all contain
a directory called dvr that contains driver programs.
<p>
The links at left provide access to all the same files that
can be accessed through the links below. Once one becomes familiar
with the various files, these shortcut links provide a more
convenient way to access the code.
<ul>
<li>	<i>D-heap</i>. Data structure for d-heap defined on items numbered
	[1,n].
	<a href="dheap.h" target="main">Class definition (.h file)</a>.
	<a href="dheap.c" target="main">Code for operations (.c file)</a>.
	<a href="dvr/dheap_d.c" target="main">Driver</a>.
<li>	<i>M-heap</i>. Data structure for "modulo" version of d-heap
	which compares keys using modular arithmetic.
	This is intended for use in applications where the key values
	represent time values that may "wrap-around" and where the
	range valid key values is always close to the "current time".
	<a href="mheap.h" target="main">Class definition (.h file)</a>.
	<a href="mheap.c" target="main">Code for operations (.c file)</a>.
	<a href="dvr/mheap_d.c" target="main">Driver</a>.
<li>	<i>Leftist Heaps Data Structure</i>. Data structure representing a
	collection of leftist heaps that define a
	partition on a set of items numbered [1,n].
	<a href="lheaps.h" target="main">Class definition (.h file)</a>.
	<a href="lheaps.c" target="main">Code for operations (.c file)</a>.
	<a href="dvr/lheaps_d.c" target="main">Driver</a>.
<li>	<i>Lazy leftist Heaps Data Structure</i>. Data structure representing a
	collection of leftist heaps with lazy deletion that define a
	partition on a set of items numbered [1,n].
	<a href="llheaps.h" target="main">Class definition (.h file)</a>.
	<a href="llheaps.c" target="main">Code for operations (.c file)</a>.
	<a href="dvr/llheaps_d.c" target="main">Driver</a>.
<li>	<i>Fibonacci Heaps Data Structure</i>. Data structure representing a
	collection of Fibonacci heaps that define a
	partition on a set of items numbered [1,n].
	<a href="fheaps.h" target="main">Class definition (.h file)</a>.
	<a href="fheaps.c" target="main">Code for operations (.c file)</a>.
	<a href="dvr/fheaps_d.c" target="main">Driver</a>.
