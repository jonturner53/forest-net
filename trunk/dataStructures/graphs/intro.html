<h1>Graph Data Structures</i></h1>
<p>
This page provides links to source code for several types of graphs
The data structures are implemented as C++ classes,
so there is a header file (.h) and source file (.c) for each
data structure. There is also an associated driver,
which can be used to do some basic verification of the implementation.
<p>
The links at left provide access to all the same files that
can be accessed through the links below. Once one becomes familiar
with the various files, these shortcut links provide a more
convenient way to access the code.
<ul>
<li>	<i>Undirected Graph</i>. Generic graph data structure. Vertices
	and edges are identified by integers [1,n] and [1,m] respectively.
	Includes methods for traversing graph using doubly linked
	adjacency lists, generating random graphs,
	reading a graph from a file and writing one out.
	<a href="graph.h" target="main">Class definition (.h file)</a>.
	<a href="graph.c" target="main">Code for operations (.c file)</a>.
	<a href="dvr/graph_d.c" target="main">Driver</a>.
	An edge-weighted version is also provided (implemented as a
	derived class of the unweighted version).
	<a href="wgraph.h" target="main">Class definition (.h file)</a>.
	<a href="wgraph.c" target="main">Code for operations (.c file)</a>.
	<a href="dvr/wgraph_d.c" target="main">Driver</a>.
<li>	<i>Directed Graph</i>. This version is a derived class of the
	undirected graph and provides additional methods appropriate for
	directed graphs.
	<a href="digraph.h" target="main">Class definition (.h file)</a>.
	<a href="digraph.c" target="main">Code for operations (.c file)</a>.
	<a href="dvr/digraph_d.c" target="main">Driver</a>.
	An edge-weighted version is also provided (implemented as a
	derived class of the unweighted version).
	<a href="wdigraph.h" target="main">Class definition (.h file)</a>.
	<a href="wdigraph.c" target="main">Code for operations (.c file)</a>.
	<a href="dvr/wdigraph_d.c" target="main">Driver</a>.
<li>	<i>Flow Graph</i>. This version is used by algorithms that find
	maximum flows in graphs. It is implemented as a derived class of the
	directed graph and provides additional methods appropriate for
	solving flow problems.
	<a href="flograph.h" target="main">Class definition (.h file)</a>.
	<a href="flograph.c" target="main">Code for operations (.c file)</a>.
	<a href="dvr/flograph_d.c" target="main">Driver</a>.
	An edge-weighted version is also provided (implemented as a
	derived class of the unweighted version).
	<a href="wflograph.h" target="main">Class definition (.h file)</a>.
	<a href="wflograph.c" target="main">Code for operations (.c file)</a>.
	<a href="dvr/wflograph_d.c" target="main">Driver</a>.
