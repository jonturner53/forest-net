<h1>Search Trees</i></h1>
<p>
This page provides links to source code for search trees.
The data structures are implemented as C++ classes,
so there is a header file (.h) and source file (.c) for each
data structure. Most data structures also have an associated
driver, which is a command that can be used to exercise the
various data structure operations and verify that the code works
as expected.
<p>
A makefile is provided. It assumes a certain directory
structure. In particular, the different data structure
directories all have a common parent and all contain
a directory called dvr that contains driver programs.
<p>
The links at left provide access to all the same files that
can be accessed through the links below. Once one becomes familiar
with the various files, these shortcut links provide a more
convenient way to access the code.

	collection of binary search trees that defines a partition
	on a set of items numbered [1,n].

<li>	<i>Self-Adjusting Binary Search Trees</i>. Data structure representing a
	collection of self-adjusting binary search trees that defines
	a partition on a set of items numbered [1,n].
