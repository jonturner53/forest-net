<h1>CSE 542 Source Code</i></h1>
<p>
This page provides links to source code for students in CSE 542.
There are two major categories of programs: data structures and
algorithms. The various groups of programs within each
category are described briefly below.
<p>
<h2>Data Structures</h2>
<ul>
<li>	<a href="dataStructures/basic/" target="_parent"><i>Basic</i></a>.
	The programs in this group implement lists, collections of lists
	and partitions.
<li>	<a href="dataStructures/graphs/" target="_parent"><i>Graphs</i></a>.
	The programs in this group implement implement several kinds
	of graphs, including undirected graphs, directed graphs and
	flow graphs (used to solve network flow problems).
	An edge-weighted version of each type is also provided.
<li>	<a href="dataStructures/heaps/" target="_parent"><i>Heaps</i></a>.
	The programs in this group implement several types of heaps,
	including d-heaps, leftist heaps and Fibonacci heaps.
<li>	<a href="dataStructures/searchTrees/" target="_parent"><i>Search
	Trees</i></a>.
	The programs in this group implement several types of search trees,
	including simple (unbalanced) binary search trees and
	self-adjusting binary search trees.
<li>	<a href="dataStructures/advanced/" target=_parent><i>Advanced</i></a>.
	The programs in this group implement various advanced data structures
	including path sets and dynamic trees.
</ul>
<h2>Algorithms</h2>
<ul>
<li>	<a href="graphAlgorithms/misc/" target="_parent"><i>Miscellaneous</i></a>.
	The programs in this group implement miscellaneous functions,
	including breadth-first search, nearest-common ancestor and
	random graph generation.
<li>	<a href="graphAlgorithms/mst/" target="_parent"><i>Minimum
	Spanning Tree</i></a>.
	The programs in this group implement algorithms for the
	minimum spanning tree problem.
	They include Kruskal's algorithm, Prim's algorithm
	and the Round Robin algorithm.
<li>	<a href="graphAlgorithms/sPath/" target="_parent"><i>Shortest
	Paths</i></a>.
	The programs in this group implement algorithms for the
	shortest path problem.
	They include Dijkstra's algorithm, the breadth-first scanning
	algorithm and Floyd's algorithm.
<li>	<a href="graphAlgorithms/maxFlo/" target="_parent"><i>Maximum
	Flow</i></a>.
	The programs in this group implement algorithms for the
	maximum flow problem.
	They include the shortest augmenting path algorithm, Dinic's
	algorithm and Sleator & Tarjan's algorithm. 
<li>	<a href="graphAlgorithms/mcFlo/" target="_parent"><i>Minimum
	Cost Flow</i></a>.
	The programs in this group implement algorithms for the
	minimum cost flow problem.
<li>	<a href="graphAlgorithms/match/" target="_parent"><i>Matchings</i></a>.
	The programs in this group implement algorithms for the
	matching problem.
</ul>
<h2>Miscellany</h2>
<ul>
<li>	<i>Miscellaneous Utilities</i>.
	Like it says.
	<a href="misc/misc.h">.h file</a>, <a href="misc/misc.c">.c file</a>.
</ul>

The programs are organized into several directories and
sub-directories. At the top level, there are directories
called <i>include</i>, <i>dataStructures</i>, <i>algorithms</i>,
<i>misc</i> and <i>lib</i>.
There is a makefile at the top level, which recursively invokes
makefiles in the sub-directores and builds several libraries:
lib-ds, lib-ga, lib-misc, which are stored in the lib sub-directory.
The top-level makefile includes some definitions that should be
modified to reflect the full path name of the directory
containing the top-level makefile.
A "make clean" command will reset all directories and
a "make all" command will re-build all the programs.
<p>
The web pages provide a convenient way to browse the code
and get an understanding of the programs. A tarfile of the
entire directory structure is also available
<a href="cse542tarfile">here</a>.
Download the tarfile (by right-clicking on the above link)
to a unix or linux system and move it to the desired
file system location, then type "tar xf cse542tarfile"
to get your own working copy of all the programs.
