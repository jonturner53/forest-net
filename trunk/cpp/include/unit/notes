Thoughts on testing strategies

Need to add unit tests wherever feasible, to cut down on silly bugs
that must be tracked in full system. Start with Utest tools and build
basic set of tests for all components that can be tested in isolation.
Use toString() to check state, and when mismatch, print expected and
mismatched strings.

Packet.cpp
Format a packet, copy it, clear copy's fields then unpack
and check.

CtlPkt.cpp
For each control packet type, format the packet, make copy and
unpack to new control packet. Then compare fields.
Repeat for replies. May want to script this.

Forest.cpp
Check various static methods.

Logger.cpp
Misc.cpp
NetBuffer.cpp
Np4d.cpp
Packet.cpp
PacketFilter.cpp
PacketLog.cpp
PacketStore.cpp
PacketStoreTs.cpp
Queue.cpp
RateSpec.cpp
RepeatHandler.cpp
Repeater.cpp
