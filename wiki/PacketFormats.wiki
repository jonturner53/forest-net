#summary Description of Forest packet formats

= Forest Packet Formats =

Forest is designed to operate as an overlay network,
so Forest packets are typically carried within UDP packets.
Forest packets have a fixed format which is described below.

  * _Version number_. This is the first four bits of the first word and is currently equal to 1. 
  * _Packet Length_. This is specified in bytes and is a 12 bit field. The maximum allowed value is 1450.
  * _Packet Type_. This is an 8 bit field. The specific packet types are listed below.
  * _Flags_. This is an 8 bit field. The specific flags available are listed below.
  * _Comtree_. This is a 32 bit field and identifies the comtree that this packet belongs to. 
  * _Source Address_. This is a 32 bit field that represents the unicast address of the endpoint that sent the packet.
  * _Destination Address_. This is a 32 bit field that may be either a unicast or multicast address.
  * _Header Error Check_. This is a 32 bit check sum over the header fields.
  * _Payload Error Check_. This is a 32 bit check sum computed over the payload (not the header).
